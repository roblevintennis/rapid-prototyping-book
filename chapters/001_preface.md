#Preface

In this book we'll be covering rapid workflows that utilize modern tooling from the perspective of the front-end developer, or _rapid prototyper_ (although designers, managers, and anyone who needs to build web sites efficiently might want to read too). This approach uses cutting edge front-end tooling to achieve amazingly rapid developer workflow. While we respect that you've likely aready developed you're own personal favorite workflow rituals, we will attempt to persuade you that there may be sexier approaches you should add to your repetoire.

The pace of the book will be quite fast as we'll favor brevity over long winded explanations so we can dig deeper in to "doing". Therefore, we'll be making heavy use of web links to places to get more detailed coverage on topics we might seem to breeze past.

**Programming Language and Syntaxes**

Most of the examples will use some type of language or syntax familiar to many front-end developers:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
* Command line

But we will also be using some tool-specific syntaxes like:

* [Compass][compass] and [Sass][sass] (the .scss version)
* Tool specific syntaxes (e.g. [Grunt][grunt], [Bower][bower], [Yeoman][yeoman], etc.)

**Assumptions**

This book assumes experience with core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Resources**

I've generally listed any resources as clickable web links that you can learn more from, or, as links to where you might purchase the book that I'm referencing.

**Line breaks in code**

I've taken the liberty of purposely wrapping long lines that won't fit within the width of the page.

**Contributions**

I am definitely open to collaborative authorship (hey, I did put it on github!), provided that other authors follow the general style and spirit of the book. At some point, I'll try to define this all in a more concrete way. If you do want to contribute, you'll probably want to have a good look at the commented Makefile, and also notice the use of "extra lines" between code samples. I've managed to find workarounds for the somewhat finicky pandoc/docbook tool-chain (and I'm thankful that it works at all since these tools really make life so much easier!)

**Special acknowledgement**

[Addy Osmani][addy] has made many community contributions in the area developer education and has encouraged others to do the same. His contributions are generally open source, and, for example, I looked at the build process he used in his [Essential JS Design Patterns][addybook] book, and shamelessly _lifted_ the pandoc build process we're using for this book!
